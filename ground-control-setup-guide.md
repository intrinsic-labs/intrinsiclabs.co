# Ground Control Stack Overview - Implementation Guide

Ground Control is a client-focused platform designed to securely manage and deliver personalized guidebooks and project documentation. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and Sanity CMS, Ground Control provides authenticated, secure access tailored to individual users.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Next.js**: Primary web framework with SSR/ISR capabilities
- **Supabase**: Authentication provider and session management
- **Sanity CMS**: Content management with client-specific organization
- **Additional Infrastructure**: Caching layer, CDN, rate limiting

### Authentication Flow
1. Middleware-based route protection for all `/guidebook/*` routes
2. Google OAuth via Supabase with session validation
3. Automatic redirect handling for unauthenticated users
4. User context propagation through request headers

### Content Management Flow
1. Client-specific content organization by user ID in Sanity
2. Server-side content fetching with proper authentication checks
3. Content versioning and publication state management
4. Caching strategy for performance optimization

## Key Implementation Priorities

### 1. Security Enhancements
- **Replace page-level auth checks with Next.js middleware** for consistent route protection
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse (suggest 100 requests/minute per IP)
- **Add refresh token rotation** for extended session security
- **Server-side only content access** - never expose content directly to client

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Implement caching strategy** using Next.js unstable_cache or Redis
- **Add ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for less frequently changing content
- **CDN integration** for static assets
- **Database query optimization** with proper indexing in Sanity

### 3. Enhanced Content Management
- **Upgrade Sanity schema** to include:
  - Content validation rules (required fields, length limits)
  - Lifecycle fields (createdAt, updatedAt, isPublished, version)
  - Better preview functionality
- **Error handling and fallbacks** for content loading failures
- **Empty state handling** when users have no content

### 4. Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive error boundaries** with user-friendly messages
- **Structured logging** for authentication attempts and content access
- **Performance monitoring** for page load times and API responses
- **Security monitoring** for suspicious authentication patterns

## Environment Configuration Requirements

### Development vs Production
- Separate environment configurations for each stage
- Secure secret management across environments
- API token rotation strategy for Sanity
- Proper CORS and domain restrictions

### Required Environment Variables
- Supabase: URL, anon key, service role key
- Sanity: Project ID, dataset, API token
- Application: NextAuth URL and secret
- Optional: Redis URL for caching

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Security Foundation
1. Implement middleware-based authentication
2. Add rate limiting
3. Enhance error handling
4. Set up proper environment configuration

### Phase 2: Performance & Reliability
1. Implement caching strategy
2. Add ISR for appropriate content
3. Enhance Sanity schema with validation
4. Add comprehensive error boundaries

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Optimization
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement security logging
3. CDN integration for static assets
4. Database query optimization

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Middleware Over Page-Level Auth
- Consistent security across all protected routes
- Reduced code duplication
- Better performance (single auth check per request)
- Easier maintenance and debugging

### Content Security Strategy
- All content fetching happens server-side
- User context validated on every request
- Content filtered by user ID at database level
- No sensitive data exposed to client-side

### Scalability Considerations
- Sanity scales content management without code changes
- Supabase handles authentication at scale
- Caching reduces database load
- ISR provides fast content delivery

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Session Management
**Solution**: Implement refresh token rotation and proper session validation in middleware

### Challenge: Content Performance
**Solution**: Multi-layered caching strategy with ISR and database optimization

### Challenge: Security at Scale
**Solution**: Rate limiting, comprehensive logging, and regular security audits

### Challenge: Error Recovery
**Solution**: Graceful degradation with proper error boundaries and user feedback

## Success Metrics

### Security
- Zero unauthorized content access
- Successful rate limiting implementation
- Clean security audit logs

### Performance
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- 99%+ authentication success rate
- Effective cache hit ratios

### User Experience
- Intuitive error messages
- Seamless authentication flow
- Fast content delivery
